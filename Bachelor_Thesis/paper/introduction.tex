\section{Introduction}
As our society is becoming increasingly dependent on technology, the demand for better and more efficient technologies is growing. Out current classical computers have reached a limit where the transistors cannot get any smaller without quantum mechanics causing issues. This has prompted research into quantum technologies such as quantum computers and quantum simulations. To properly understand how quantum mechanical systems work, it is important to understand what happens to them when they are interacted with, during for example a measurement. It is also interesting to see how such a system can be manipulated to create a certain state which can be used for a specific purpose.
