\section{Outlook}
The field of measurement and feedback based cooling seems to be a promising way to cool quantum systems. As mentioned in the discussion, implementing detectors with finite bandwidth is an important consideration for future research as this would more accurately model a real system. 

Furthermore, this thesis only consider one type of feedback scheme, looking at the feedback hamiltonian as a linear modification of the position and momentum quadratures. There is promising work to be done either considering modifying the position of the potential akin to \cite{De-Sousa:2025}, or modifying the frequency of the oscillator similar to \cite{Habibi:2016}. The latter would be interesting as it seems to have a more direct application in quantum optomechanics.
