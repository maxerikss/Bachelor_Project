\section{Theoretical Framework}
\subsection{Quantum Harmonic Oscillator}
The quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO) is a quantum mechanical system useful for many applications. This stems from the fact that many systems can be approximated as harmonic close to their equilibrium position, and since the QHO is a simple system, which is possible to solve analytically it is a good starting approximation. The system has the Hamiltonian
\begin{equation}
    \hamiltonian = \frac{\pop^2}{2m} + \frac{1}{2}m\omega^2\xop^2 = \hbar\omega\left(\ad\a + \frac{1}{2}\right),
\end{equation}
where $\pop$ and $\xop$ are the momentum and position operators, $m$ is the mass of the particle, and $\omega$ is the angular frequency of the oscillator. The operators $\ad$ and $\a$ are the creation and annihilation operators, which are defined as
\begin{equation}
    \a = \sqrt{\frac{m\omega}{2\hbar}} \left(\xop + \frac{i}{m\omega} \pop\right) \quad \text{and} \quad \ad = \sqrt{\frac{m\omega}{2\hbar}} \left(\xop - \frac{i}{m\omega} \pop\right).
\end{equation}
It is also reasonable to mention the number operator $\hat{n} = \ad\a$ which has the number states, or Fock states, $\ket{n}$ as its eigenstates.

\subsection{Open Quantum Systems}
With an open quantum system we mean a quantum system which in some ways interact with an environment. This interaction could be described as a thermal coupling between the main system and some temperature bath. This will cause the system to be in a thermal equilibrium with the environment if left alone, and therefore it will be dependent on the temperature. Unless the temperature of the bath is zero, the system will be in a mixed state, described by a density matrix $\dmatrix$. Notably, if the temperature is zero, it is equivalent of considering a closed quantum system, since the coupling is thermal. 

The thermal coupling will lead to dissipation of quantum information from the system to the environment. During this process, the system loses coherence. That is, the quantum mechanical properties of the system are lost and a classical description of the state becomes more appropriate. The coherence of the system is manifested in the off-diagonal elements of the density matrix.
