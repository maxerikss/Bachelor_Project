@article{Habibi:2016,
	abstract = {We revisit the problem of preparing a mechanical oscillator in the vicinity of its quantum-mechanical ground state by means of feedback cooling based on continuous optical detection of the oscillator position. In the parameter regime relevant to ground-state cooling, the optical back-action and imprecision noise set the bottleneck of achievable cooling and must be carefully balanced. This can be achieved by adapting the phase of the local oscillator in the homodyne detection realizing a so-called variational measurement. The trade-off between accurate position measurement and minimal disturbance can be understood in terms of Heisenberg's microscope and becomes particularly relevant when the measurement and feedback processes happen to be fast within the quantum coherence time of the system to be cooled. This corresponds to the regime of large quantum cooperativity , which was achieved in recent experiments on feedback cooling. Our method provides a simple path to further pushing the limits of current state-of-the-art experiments in quantum optomechanics.},

@article{Pekola:2024,
	abstract = {We discuss the concept and realization of a heat bath in solid state quantum systems. We demonstrate that, unlike a true resistor, a finite one-dimensional Josephson junction array or analogously a transmission line with non-vanishing frequency spacing, commonly considered as a reservoir of a quantum circuit, does not strictly qualify as a Caldeira--Leggett type dissipative environment. We then consider a set of quantum two-level systems as a bath, which can be realized as a collection of qubits. We show that only a dense and wide distribution of energies of the two-level systems can secure long Poincare recurrence times characteristic of a proper heat bath. An alternative for this bath is a collection of harmonic oscillators, for instance, in the form of superconducting resonators.},

@book{Breuer:2007,
	abstract = {This book treats the central physical concepts and mathematical techniques used to investigate the dynamics of open quantum systems. To provide a self-contained presentation, the text begins with a survey of classical probability theory and with an introduction to the foundations of quantum mechanics, with particular emphasis on its statistical interpretation and on the formulation of generalized measurement theory through quantum operations and effects. The fundamentals of density matrix theory, quantum Markov processes, and completely positive dynamical semigroups are developed. The most important master equations used in quantum optics and condensed matter theory are derived and applied to the study of many examples. Special attention is paid to the Markovian and non-Markovian theory of environment induced decoherence, its role in the dynamical description of the measurement process, and to the experimental observation of decohering electromagnetic field states. The book includes the modern formulation of open quantum systems in terms of stochastic processes in Hilbert space. Stochastic wave function methods and Monte Carlo algorithms are designed and applied to important examples from quantum optics and atomic physics. The fundamentals of the treatment of non-Markovian quantum processes in open systems are developed on the basis of various mathematical techniques, such as projection superoperator methods and influence functional techniques. In addition, the book expounds the relativistic theory of quantum measurements and the density matrix theory of relativistic quantum electrodynamics.},

	abstract = {This book adopts a novel, physics-first approach to quantum measurement, using physical experiments as the basis to describe the underlying mathematical formalism. Topics covered include weak measurements, quantum measurement reversal, quantum trajectories and the stochastic path integral formalism. The theory of quantum measurement is also covered in detail, including discussion of how it can be tested and demonstrated in a laboratory: how to build quantum-limited amplifiers, fundamental noise limits imposed on measurement by quantum mechanics, and the design of superconducting circuits. This text is an excellent introduction for students with a basic understanding of quantum mechanics wanting to learn more about measurement theory, and the inclusion of a wide selection of end-of-chapter exercises make this book ideal for emerging courses on the topic. Key chapters introducing the foundations of quantum computing and the history of measurement theory are equally accessible to a broader, less specialised audience.},
