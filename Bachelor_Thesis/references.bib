@book{Nielsen:2010,
	abstract = {One of the most cited books in physics of all time, Quantum Computation and Quantum Information remains the best textbook in this exciting field of science. This 10th anniversary edition includes an introduction from the authors setting the work in context. This comprehensive textbook describes such remarkable effects as fast quantum algorithms, quantum teleportation, quantum cryptography and quantum error-correction. Quantum mechanics and computer science are introduced before moving on to describe what a quantum computer is, how it can be used to solve problems faster than 'classical' computers and its real-world implementation. It concludes with an in-depth treatment of quantum information. Containing a wealth of figures and exercises, this well-known textbook is ideal for courses on the subject, and will interest beginning graduate students and researchers in physics, computer science, mathematics, and electrical engineering.},

@book{Jordan:2024,
	abstract = {This book adopts a novel, physics-first approach to quantum measurement, using physical experiments as the basis to describe the underlying mathematical formalism. Topics covered include weak measurements, quantum measurement reversal, quantum trajectories and the stochastic path integral formalism. The theory of quantum measurement is also covered in detail, including discussion of how it can be tested and demonstrated in a laboratory: how to build quantum-limited amplifiers, fundamental noise limits imposed on measurement by quantum mechanics, and the design of superconducting circuits. This text is an excellent introduction for students with a basic understanding of quantum mechanics wanting to learn more about measurement theory, and the inclusion of a wide selection of end-of-chapter exercises make this book ideal for emerging courses on the topic. Key chapters introducing the foundations of quantum computing and the history of measurement theory are equally accessible to a broader, less specialised audience.},

@phdthesis{Annby-Andersson:2024,
	abstract = {Technological and scientific advancements over the past 30-40 years make it possible to fabricate nanometer-sized systems where fluctuations and quantum effects are important features. These systems can be controlled and measured with high accuracy, making them suitable for exploring fundamental aspects of the microscopic world. This thesis makes contributions in this direction, focusing on the theory of continuous, Markovian feedback control and stochastic as well as quantum thermodynamics.In Paper I and III, we study an implementation of Maxwell's demon in a double quantum dot. A feedback protocol, based on charge detection, transfers electrons against an external voltage bias, without performing any net work. The protocol is studied for both classical and quantum dynamics. We characterize the electronic transport properties, explore information-to-work conversion with realistic detector models, as well as the quantum-to-classical transition.Paper II introduces a novel master equation for continuous, Markovian feedback control. This equation describes the dynamics of a quantum system and a detector with finite bandwidth. For a fast detector, the equation reduces to a Markovian master equation for the system alone. This equation can describe protocols that depend linearly as well as nonlinearly on the measured signal. For linear protocols, this equation coincides with theWiseman-Milburn equation, illustrating a compelling connection to previous work in the field.Paper IV investigates a specific feedback protocol for increasing the entanglement generation in an autonomous thermal machine. Under optimal conditions, we find that the protocol significantly increases the entanglement. The entanglement violates the CHSH inequality and can uphold quantum teleportation.Paper V presents a setup for generating maximally entangled states in autonomous thermal machines. First, we show that maximal bipartite entanglement can be generated in a system of three qubits. This is later generalized to a setup of 2n −1 qubits.Paper VI develops a model for Bayesian temperature estimation with continuous measurements. We study adaptive as well as non-adaptive strategies, and find that the adaptive strategy improves estimation precision. },
